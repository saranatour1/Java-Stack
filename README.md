This is the folder Structure for the Java Stack Submissions, This will be updated each week/day:

 ```bash

# Java Spring +Boot

---

This is a small summary of the project documentation for using jsp and java projects in general. 

### Overview

Why spring? Frameworks in general are supposed to make your life 10x times easier as a developer, this is where spring comes into play as explained on there website:

**[Why Spring](https://spring.io/why-spring)**

- [Microservices](https://spring.io/microservices)
- [Reactive](https://spring.io/reactive)
- [Event Driven](https://spring.io/event-driven)
- [Cloud](https://spring.io/cloud)
- [Web Applications](https://spring.io/web-applications)
- [Serverless](https://spring.io/serverless)
- [Batch](https://spring.io/batch)

What I currently relate with is having microservices , building web applications, and serverless applications, Although I will be mainly using for building web applications only. 

### Configuration

So, After assuming that You have downloaded spring boot suite from their GitHub repo, and it has been installed correctly, weâ€™ll move to creating a project. 

- Note :
    
    I have downloaded â€˜dark-darkestâ€™ mode, this is why my dashboard looks like this. 
    

### Creating a new project

1. Choose a new folder directory to place your project in, then
2. create a new java project by going to file â†’  new â†’ java project,
3. untick the add module thingy.
4. add a package to the src , call it â€˜com.â€™domainâ€™.helloâ€™  or whatever , and  add a class ,
5. Work on your classes like normal and you should be good. 

### Creating a new project on spring

<aside>
ðŸ“¢ Apache Maven is a popular build automation tool and project management tool for Java-based projects. It simplifies the build process by managing the project's dependencies and providing a standardized approach to build configuration.

************Steps:************ 

1. Create  a Spring boot starter project
